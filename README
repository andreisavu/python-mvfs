Python multiversion file system
-------------------------------

An easy solution you can use if you need to store multiple or all versions.

The library is built on top of the standard filesystem.

You can edit older versions

How the api looks like?
-----------------------

import mvfs

storage = mvfs.Storage('/base/folder/')

f = storage.open('/some/file/path')

with storage.open('/path/in/the/virtual/fs', ts=1234) as f:
    f.write('something')
