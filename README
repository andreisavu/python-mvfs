Python multiversion file system
-------------------------------

An easy solution you can use if you need to store multiple or all versions.

The library is built on top of the standard filesystem.

You can edit older versions

How the api looks like?
-----------------------

import mvfs

storage = mvfs.Storage('/base/folder/')

f = storage.open('/some/file/path', 'r') # open the latest revision for reading
f = storage.open('/path', 'r', ts=2344) # open the revision created before this timestamp

f = storage.open('/existing/path', 'w') # a new revision is created and a lock is created

# create a new context and open an older revision for writing
with storage.open('/path/in/the/virtual/fs', 'w', ts=23) as f:
    f.write('something')
